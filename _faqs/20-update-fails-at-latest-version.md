Some - especially commercial - plugins will include their own upgrade routines which may overrule the TGMPA upgrade instructions.
Try deactivating the plugin before trying to update. If the upgrade works when the plugin is deactivated, the above will be the reason the update didn't work earlier.

If the update still doesn't work, please [report this as a bug].

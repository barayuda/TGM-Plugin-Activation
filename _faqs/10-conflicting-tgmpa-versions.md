title:     My theme/plugin includes the latest version of TGMPA, but it seems an older version of TGMPA is used. What gives ?

There may be more themes/plugins active on your WordPress install which use TGMPA. The first version of TGMPA WordPress encounters will be used. This may not be the version included in your theme/plugin.

If you or your end-user experience bugs which have been solved in recent versions of TGMPA, try and find out which other theme/plugin is installed which includes TGMPA and contact the theme/plugin author and urge them to upgrade their TGMPA version.

FYI - the loading order within WordPress is as follows:

1. Must-use plugins in alphabetical order
2. Plugins
3. The active theme

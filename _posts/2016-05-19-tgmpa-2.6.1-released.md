### TGMPA 2.6.1 released

As the [TGMPA 2.6.0 release] contained a minor, but very visible and annoying little bug in a particular string replacement, we're releasing patch version 2.6.1 today which gets rid of this issue.

The [Custom TGMPA Generator] has been updated to now use this version of TGMPA, so go on and [download] your customized copy now!

We like to thank [Nilambar Sharma] for reporting this issue to us quickly.

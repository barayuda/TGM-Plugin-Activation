For those of you who use [WP CLI], we've got some great news: [Joshua Priddle] has created an extension for WP CLI which provides a `wp tgmpa-plugin` command allowing you to interact with TGMPA from within the WP CLI environment.

For more information and extensive usage examples, visit Joshua's [WP CLI TGMPA Plugin] repository.

### The future of TGMPA

Since last summer, we've been slowly preparing ourselves to create the next version of TGMPA. The main issue we'd like to solve is multisite compatibility and we'd also like to reduce issues of conflicts between different versions of TGMPA running within one WP install.

We published a [roadmap], talked with some people of the WP core team about the possibility of TGMPA becoming a feature plugin and [asked for opinions] about this.

_**Now it is time for you to stand up and be heard.**_

We'd like to hear your opinion about the changes we are proposing.

Please help us define the future of TGMPA by taking ten minutes of your time to **[fill out the survey]**.

Your opinion is much appreciated!

Also: please spread the word about the survey to other developers. The more, the merrier.
